Userspace filesystems work by recieving notes in a particular format:
struct fs_note
{
    int8_t cmd;
    request;
} _packed

Note that note metadata, such as the sending process ID, is listed in another
metastructure.

Request takes a format such as:

struct read_request
{
    int32_t fsid;
    int64_t pos;
    int64_t len;
} _packed

Note that all integers are in little endian order.

This request then elicits a response of:

struct read_response
{
    int64_t len;
    int8_t data[];
} _packed
